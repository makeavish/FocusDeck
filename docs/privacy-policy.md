# FocusDeck Privacy Policy

Last updated: 2026-02-15

FocusDeck is designed to run locally in your browser.

## What FocusDeck stores (local only)

FocusDeck stores the following in extension local storage (`storage.local`):

- Session config (mode, limits, theme preference)
- Session snapshot (for automatic route pause/resume and focus restoration)
- Daily limits (total daily post limit + internal minute-budget compatibility fields)
- Daily usage counters (posts viewed and active minutes, plus internal compatibility counters)
- Site settings used internally for adapter behavior defaults

## What FocusDeck does not collect

- No account sign-in data
- No server-side analytics
- No selling or sharing of personal data
- No remote code loading for core behavior

## Network behavior

FocusDeck core behavior does not require extension-owned outbound network requests.
Any observed network traffic is generated by the website you are visiting (for example X.com), not by FocusDeck telemetry uploads.

## User-initiated actions

Actions such as `Not interested` and `Save` are triggered only from explicit user gestures (click/keyboard), and are rate-limited.

## Contact

For store submission updates, maintain this file in-repo and keep extension listing language aligned with this policy.
